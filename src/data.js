And the best steak restaurant aswell. Went here on my birthday, got a nice gift, the best ever. I didnt like the beach though, to many rocks. Visited Monaco, boyfriend played Casino and won. I wanna live here! Also really liked the McDonalds here...",

        description: "Best holiday ever with couple of friends. Went to the little city Le Levandou in the South of France. So beautiful. Spend all time bathing in the pool, visit the beach and eat a lot of France Tapas. We drove up in the mountains and found a place where we could jump from rocks in the most beautiful blue river. Had my birthday here and went for a trip on a watercraft. So fun, but so cold. ",

But had a great time anyway, visiting the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris and Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris. Also went for a little boat trip and tried the best burgers and a (not so good) michelin restaurant.",
